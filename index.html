								<p>
									My name is Genki Narimoto, and I'm fifteen years old. I've spent all of my life living in Southern California, and I love it here. I'd like to say I'm a very naturally outgoing and energetic person with many different quality traits. People tend to say that I am also very disciplined and hard working when it comes to things that I have a lot of passion for. I have to admit, I kind of agree, as whatever I have put my mind to, I have achieved.
								</p>
								<p>
									I tend to look at things in my life and wonder how to improve them. I identify my weakest points and I strengthen them. Because of this lifestyle, I believe that I was able to build the life that I am living today. The balance between all that is going on in my life is kept through the hard work and dedication I put into it. If not for this way of thinking, I believe that nothing that I value would be in my life currently.

								<h3 class="major">Yoga</h3>
									<p>
										I picked up yoga in September of last year and have loved it ever since. I think yoga is a very healthy hobby to have considering the health and physical benefits that it has on the body. Yoga makes me feel very dissolved, at peace, and present in the moment and my body feels activated after finishing sessions.
									</p>
									<p>
										I usually do yoga before or after practice to improve recovery or prepare for activity. Doing yoga before workouts really improves how much you gain from the workout. Instead of being confined by your muscle soreness, you are able to commense the workout with complete readiness of what is to come. Rather than breaking down due to the difficulty of practice, you can rest and recover your body prior to going to sleep. I really believe yoga is a powerful tool that everyone can utilize.
									</p>
								<h3>Reading</h3>
								<p>
									I was never a passionate reader my whole life. In fact, I was actually against reading for the majority of my lifetime, and usually did not read unless forced to. Recently, however, I've realized the power of reading and the information you can gain from it. Ever since that realization, I've been reading at least every other day.
								</p>
								<p>
									I'm a big advocate for the self-help and fiction genres of reading, with self-help books in my life giving me the knowledge I need to succeed, and fiction genres improving my overall reading and comprehension skills.
								</p>
								<ul>
									<h4>Self-help / Philosophy books</h4>
									<li><i>How to Win Friends and Influence People - Dale Carnegie</i> | Done Reading</li>
									<li><i>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck - Mark Manson</i> | Done Reading</li>
									<li><i>Atomic Habits - James Clear</i> | Done Reading</li>
									<li><i>Meditations - Marcus Aurelius</i> | Currently Reading</li>
									<li><i>Hard Times Create Strong Men - Stefan Aarnio</i> | Interested in</li>
									<li><i>Ikigai - Hector Garcia</i> | Interested in</li>
									<li><i>Discourses and Selected Writings - Epictetus</i> | Interested in</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Youtube</h3>
								<p>
									Recently, I've picked up some new genres of videos on YouTube that have really enlightened my life in times of great stress in school and sports. These genres include productivity, self-help/self-improvement, NBA/Basketball, and popular Japanese creators. The presence of YouTube in my life has always been big, but I feel like I've found a side of YouTube that contributes to my improvement without ditracting me from my goals.
								</p>
								<p>
									While productivity and self-help are pretty self explanatory, I have reasoning behind why I watch Japanese creators. While not being the best use of my time, I feel like watching these creators give me a source of information about what is happening in the alternate world and home that is Japan. Having this source of content in my life feels like a bad distraction, in which it is. However, I feel like I am somewhat gaining in the form of getting me to be more of a Japanese person, which is something that I want to value.

								<h3>Kiki</h3>
								<p>
									That's a picture of my dog, Kiki! Calling my dog a hobby isn't right, but I do enjoy spending time with her a lot. Whenever I have time in the day in which I don't feel like doing much, I go on walks with her, I play fetch with her, and I pet her. She's always coming up to me expecting me to play or pet her, and I always end up doing so. I love Kiki, she's the best dog ever.

								<h3>Basketball</h3>
								<br>
								<p>
									I've been playing Basketball for as long as I can remember. I was born into the sport enjoying it a ton. I still enjoy it a lot today, and spend a great deal of time dedicated towards perfecting and improving my craft in the sport in the form of my favorite hobby/thing I do.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is also my main sport in high school and my main passion throughout middle school. Throughout my years leading up to high school, I've demonstrated significant presentation of my skills in the form of scoring, leading, and overall contribution to winning. This was done through my performance in club Basketball: being able to play at a high level, sometimes even against competition of whom were older than me, while still being able to express leadership in my ability to play the game and be vocal.
								</p>
								<p>
									I'm currently a Varsity Basketball player who has expressed a significant work ethic that I take pride in. In order to support and grow as a player and as a team, I have been able to work on my skills in Basketball, effective communication, and my path to achieving my ambitious goals in the future. This was what filled my freshman season in Basketball and will continue to fill up the rest of my years in high school.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Track.png" style="width:325px; height:425px" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Track and Field</h3>
								<br>
								<p>
									Marking the end of my Basketball season was the start of the spring season. With nothing to lose, I decided to sign up for Track and Field for the dration of the spring season. I had always been expressing talent in running and jumping, so I decided that this would be a nice opportunity to improve my physical capability to set up for a better sophomore season in Basketball.
								</p>
								<p>
									As of now, I have participated in 4 track meets with my main events being high jump, long jump, triple jump, and 100 meter dash. 
								</p>
